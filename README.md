Sublime Text 3 user data sync for cross machine usage

Personal repository to track and sync user settings on sublimetext for cross machine usage. Feel free to try my settings.

The data here usually goes into `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User` for a windows machine. Restart sublime text to allow new settings to take effect.
